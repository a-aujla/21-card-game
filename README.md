# 21-card-game
Single-player version of the card game 21 where a single player plays against the computer, who is always the dealer.

The first character represents the the rank of the card (A,1,2,...,9,T,J,Q,K) and the second represents the suit (C,D,H,S). 
The Ace always has a value of 1, and Jacks, Queens, and Kings have values of 10. 
If the player goes bust, the round ends and the dealer wins, otherwise, the dealers cards are shown and whoever is closer to 21 wins.
